# PLANNING

# To start this project I need to have a game idea/function planned: rock, paper, scissors

# From here, I'm going to makesure I have the programming language that I will be using installed
# on my system, with a reliable source for the syntax, such as variables, strings, loops, etc
# here I used w3schools.com 

# With these in mind, I can start the project

# PSEDUCODE

# Here I come I write the basic logic in psedo code in order to break the project down step by step,
# but to also ensure it's in a readable format, so If I need to debug the logic far easier 
# than If i tried to debug once I wrote everything in Python


# 1) Take a users input, and store this as x, values can only be rock, paper, or scissors

# 2) computer chooses random string between three options (Scissors, Rock, Paper) and stores as y

# 3) Now here's the fun bit I need to build

# If x = rock and y = scissors
# or if x = paper and y = rock
# or if x = scissors and y = paper

# print you win! Computer chose y

# else if x == y then print, you draw, computer also chose y

# else print, you lose, computer chose y

# Give user option to replay
