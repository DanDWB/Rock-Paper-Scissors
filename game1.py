# To start this project I need to have a game idea/function planned: rock, paper, scissors

# From here, I'm going to makesure I have the programming language that I will be using installed
# on my system, with a reliable source for the syntax, such as variables, strings, loops, etc
# here I used w3schools.com 

# With these in mind, I can start the project
