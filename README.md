# Rock Paper Scissors
 Rock Paper Scissors CLI game

My first project end to end, without copying a single piece of code from an online tutorial.  The focus here was to utilise Pseudocode, logic, and documentation.

I've also created a blog on how I tackled this project: https://faun.pub/how-to-tackle-your-first-programming-project-c1888eee868c

Hope you enjoy checking it out!
